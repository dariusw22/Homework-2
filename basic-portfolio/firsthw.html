              <p>My name is Darius Williams, I was born and raised in Durham, NC. I attended Hillside High School before I graduated from Athens Drive High School in Raleigh, NC. While in high school I was extremely active in many sports. Durning my time there I had the opportunity to excel at football, track and field, and baseball. Once I graduated from high school I attended Johnson .C. Smith University. while there I studied Biology and concentrated in Pre Medical. My original dream was to be a doctor, but after getting the chance to have some exposure to the field I realized that was not going to be for me.</p>

              <p>About half way through my college life I father suggested that I get my personal training certification. After getting my AFFA certification I started to train while still in school and quickly realized that it was a field that I could see myself in. during my undergrad years, I was highly active on campus. I had the opportunity to be a two-sport athlete while at JCSU being a member of a championship football and track and field teams. Along with being active in sports I also had the opportunity to be involved with a few programs on campus including, my fraternity and MAPS, The Minority Association of Pre Medical Students.</p>
